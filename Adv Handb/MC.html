In the opening cutscene, twin siblings from another world travel through the universe, until an unknown god blocks their path.

Together they set out on a journey to find The Seven and reunite with the Traveler's lost sibling. Although players can choose the name they want to be referred by, the Traveler's Sibling refers to the Traveler by their real name, regardless of their custom name.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Paimon is the deuteragonist of Genshin Impact. She is an open-world NPC who accompanies the Traveler throughout their adventure in Teyvat as their guide. She met the Traveler when the latter fished her out of the sea, after which she mentions she would have drowned if not saved by the Traveler. She is currently representing Genshin Impact as its mascot and is used as the icon for the game, its official website, and various social media accounts.</p>
